## QGIS 3.x project to test FGDC sysmbols.

Launch 'test-FGDC.qgz' in QGIS.
Then play with the styles of layer 'FGDC fill symbol - change style to display symbols' (right-click the layer name -> Styles -> click a style 100 to 700 to display the symbols).
The grid is shown by default (to hide it, hide the 'grid' layer).
Background colours are not shown by default (to display them, make the 'background colours' layer visible).

Composer maps are also available for printing the symbols on a A4 page portrait orientation.

Happy testing...
